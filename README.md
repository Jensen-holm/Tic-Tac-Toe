## Word Tic-Tac-Toe Project

Word Tic-Tac-Toe is a terminal game where the user plays a wordy version of the traditional <br>
Tic-Tac-Toe game against a the computer. The computer is pretty dumb however, and will <br>
randomly select the spot to play on the board, as well as the letters it claims. It would have <br>
been fun to dive into it and make a minimax algorithm bot, and different 'levels' for the user <br>
to play against ranging from random to impossible, but I did not have time for that sort of <br> 
thing with this project. Overall had a lot of fun making this. <br>

### Rules

 - When you place a word, you 'claim' the second letter in that word. <br>
 - Once you claim a letter, you can place the other words with that same letter <br>
 - That's it
