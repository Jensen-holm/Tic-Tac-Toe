## Word Tic-Tac-Toe Project with minimax AI

#### Steps:
 - Build tic tac toe game skeleton
 - Take in user input
 - Build game funcitons to place the words on the board
 - Build functions to determine if the game is won, lost, or a tie
 - Create a Bot that can play against the user
 - Create multiple different difficulty levels (hard, medium, easy, random)
 - Configure the output to be nice and pretty
 - Take user login information and keep track of statistics

The last few steps would be cool, but if I do not finish them in time
before this project is due that is okay.
